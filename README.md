# PowerShell in Action (Notes)

Markdown notes and PowerShell scripts from the Third Edition written by Bruce Payette and Richard Siddaway by Manning Publications.  The notes have been altered from the original text and isn't complete when compared to the original text, which I recommend wholeheartedly.
